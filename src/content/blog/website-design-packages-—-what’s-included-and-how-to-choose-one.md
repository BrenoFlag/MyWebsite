    <h1>Website Design Packages — What’s Included and How to Choose One</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      At Elevate Websites Design, we’ve seen firsthand how confusing it can be for small business owners to compare website design packages.
      Some companies throw around impressive words, others hide the real costs, and most rely on the same drag-and-drop templates.
      After years of building hand-coded websites for local businesses here in Atlanta and across the country, we’ve learned what truly makes
      a web design package worth your investment. In this guide, we’ll walk through what’s included, how much you should expect to pay,
      and how to choose the right package for your goals — without the jargon.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section id="cost">
    <h2>How Much Does a Small Business Website Cost?</h2>
    <p>
      Pricing can feel like a mystery in the web design world, but it doesn’t have to be.
      Over the past few years, we’ve built dozens of small business websites — from simple landing pages to multi-page service sites —
      and the average cost lands between <strong>$2,000 and $3,000</strong> for a custom, hand-coded build.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Elevate, our pricing is transparent:<br>
      <strong>Lump-Sum Plan</strong> — starts at $2,500 + $25/month hosting and maintenance.<br>
      <strong>Monthly Plan</strong> — $150/month with no upfront cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both include unlimited edits, built-in SEO, and direct support from the same developer who built your site.
      Template-based sites from builders like Wix or WordPress might seem cheaper upfront but often require constant plugin updates
      and struggle to perform well in search rankings — which ends up costing more long-term.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="inclusions">
    <h2>What’s Usually Included in a Website Design Package</h2>
    <p>
      A true website design package isn’t just a few pages with your logo — it’s a complete digital foundation for your business.
      Every Elevate site begins with a personalized consultation and ends with a site that’s ready to grow with you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Custom Design &amp; Development</strong> – Each site is hand-coded from scratch to fit your brand’s style and goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Built-In SEO Setup</strong> – Structured pages, fast-loading HTML, optimized meta descriptions, and keyword-based headings.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong> – Our code is written for speed; sites regularly score 95+ on Google PageSpeed.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Integration</strong> – Copy, images, and brand assets formatted for consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting &amp; Launch</strong> – Secure static hosting with near-instant load times and zero database vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance &amp; Unlimited Edits</strong> – Request updates anytime — no ticket systems, no waiting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This mix of design precision and technical optimization means your site doesn’t just look good —
      it performs, ranks, and converts better than template alternatives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="custom-vs-templates">
    <h2>Custom-Coded vs Templates: Speed, Security, and SEO</h2>
    <p>
      Here’s a simple truth we’ve learned from years of coding: templates save time upfront but cost performance later.
      When you hand-code a website, you remove unnecessary bloat — the scripts and plugins that slow down pages and open security holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Static, hand-coded websites don’t rely on databases, which makes them nearly impossible to hack and dramatically faster.
      One of our clients, a local photographer, saw load times drop from 4.2 s to under 1 s after switching to our static setup.
      That’s the kind of improvement Google notices — and rewards.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="tiers">
    <h2>Package Tiers Explained</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Package</strong> – Perfect for startups and solo professionals who need a clean online presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard Package</strong> – Adds multiple service pages, SEO integration, and blog setup for growing businesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Package</strong> – Includes custom integrations, animations, or scalable architecture for established brands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No matter the tier, you’ll always receive direct communication with your developer, transparent pricing,
      and performance equal to enterprise-level builds.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="how-to-choose">
    <h2>How to Choose the Right Package for Your Business</h2>
    <p>
      The right package depends on your goals, not just your budget. Start by asking yourself:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What’s the main purpose of my website — leads, visibility, or sales?</li>
      <li>How many pages or features will I need to achieve that?</li>
      <li>Do I want a long-term partner to handle SEO and updates?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We walk every client through these questions during a free consultation. Our goal isn’t to upsell —
      it’s to match you with the right solution. When your website fits your goals, it becomes an asset, not an expense.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="redesign">
    <h2>Already Have a Site? When a Redesign Makes More Sense</h2>
    <p>
      If your current site loads slowly, looks outdated, or isn’t showing up on Google, it might be time for a redesign.
      Rebuilding your site using our hand-coded framework eliminates technical debt and future-proofs your online presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After every redesign, we test your site across devices, measure load times, and validate SEO structure —
      so you launch with measurable improvements from day one.
