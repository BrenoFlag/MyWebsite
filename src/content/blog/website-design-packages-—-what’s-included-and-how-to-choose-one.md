    <h1>Website Design Packages — What’s Included and How to Choose One</h1>
    <p>
      At Elevate Websites Design, we started with a simple mission: to make professional, high-performing websites accessible to small businesses.
      The web design world is often filled with confusing packages, hidden costs, and slow-loading template sites.
      We built Elevate to change that — by offering fast, secure, hand-coded websites that are easy to maintain and designed to rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this guide, we’ll break down what’s included in our website design packages, how pricing works, and how to choose the right setup for your business goals — all without the jargon.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section id="cost">
    <h2>How Much Does a Small Business Website Cost?</h2>
    <p>
      In building websites for small businesses, we noticed that pricing can feel like a mystery — but it doesn’t have to be.
      The average small business website falls between <strong>$2,000 and $3,000</strong> for a custom, hand-coded build.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Elevate, our pricing is transparent: you can choose between a one-time payment or a monthly plan that fits your budget.
      Both include built-in SEO, hosting, maintenance, and direct support from the developer who builds your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Template-based sites might seem cheaper upfront but often require plugin updates and ongoing fixes that add up quickly.
      We design ours to perform beautifully for years without surprise costs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="included">
    <h2>What’s Usually Included in a Website Design Package</h2>
    <p>
      A true website design package is more than a few pages — it’s the foundation of your online presence.
      Every Elevate site starts with strategy and ends with a high-performing website that’s ready to grow with you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Custom Design and Development</strong> – Each site is hand-coded for your brand and business goals.</li>
      <li><strong>SEO Setup</strong> – We structure pages for Google indexing using clean HTML and optimized metadata.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong> – Sites are engineered for speed and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Integration</strong> – We style your copy, photos, and branding to look polished and consistent.</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting and Launch</strong> – Deployed on secure, static hosting with near-perfect uptime.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance and Support</strong> – Ongoing assistance and edits available whenever you need them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This approach ensures your website looks great, loads instantly, and grows with your business.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="custom-vs-templates">
    <h2>Custom-Coded vs Templates: Speed, Security, and SEO</h2>
    <p>
      Templates are convenient, but hand-coded websites outperform them in every category that matters — speed, security, and SEO.
      By writing every line of code ourselves, we eliminate the clutter that slows websites down.
      Static sites like ours have no databases to hack and load nearly instantly on any device.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, one of our recent projects for a local photographer cut load times from over four seconds to less than one.
      That performance difference directly improves search rankings and keeps visitors engaged.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="packages">
    <h2>Our Website Design Packages</h2>
    <p>
      We keep things simple — two main website design packages built around how you prefer to pay, plus a few flexible add-on packages so you only pay for what you need.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Packages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Custom design and development</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fast, secure, and mobile-friendly websites</strong></li>
      <li><strong>SEO-ready and optimized for performance</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Secure hosting already included</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Risk-free satisfaction guarantee</strong> — if we can’t design a site you’re fully satisfied with, we’ll refund you before launch.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Lump-Sum Package</strong> – A one-time investment of <strong>$2,500</strong> + $25/month for hosting and maintenance.
      This option is perfect for businesses that want to invest upfront and minimize long-term costs while keeping professional hosting and maintenance included.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Monthly Package</strong> – $150/month with no upfront cost and a <strong>one-year commitment</strong>.
      Includes the same premium, hand-coded website, hosting, maintenance, and support — ideal for new businesses that want predictable payments and ongoing care.
    </p>

    <h3>Add-On Packages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unlimited Edits Add-On</strong> – $50/month for small copy or image changes anytime — no hourly charges.</li>
      <li><strong>Blog Integration Add-On</strong> – $250 one-time fee to add a self-managed blog accessible from anywhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly SEO Add-On</strong> – Custom pricing based on the number of posts or keywords targeted per month.</li>
      <li><strong>Extra Pages Add-On</strong> – $100 per additional page (basic internal pages); custom-quoted for advanced page designs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This structure gives you flexibility and transparency — you’ll always know exactly what you’re paying for, and every feature is built for long-term performance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="choose">
    <h2>How to Choose the Right Package for Your Business</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing the right website design package starts with understanding your goals.
      If you need a simple, fast site to establish your presence, the monthly plan is a great start.
      If you prefer to pay once and reduce monthly costs, the lump-sum package offers lasting value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about what matters most: flexibility, ownership, or growth potential.
      During your free consultation, we’ll walk you through each option so you can make the right choice with confidence.
    </p>

  <section id="redesign">
    <h2>Already Have a Site? When a Redesign Makes More Sense</h2>
    <p>
      If your website feels outdated, loads slowly, or struggles to show up on Google, it may be time for a redesign.
      Rebuilding your site using our hand-coded framework eliminates unnecessary plugins, improves security, and boosts performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      After every redesign, we test load times, responsiveness, and SEO structure so your new site launches with measurable improvements from day one.
