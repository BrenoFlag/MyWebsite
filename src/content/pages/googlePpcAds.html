<!-- ============================================
    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.
